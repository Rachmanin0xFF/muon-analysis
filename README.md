# muon-analysis

I wrote a not-insignificant amount of code for a school research project, so I figured I'd dump it in here.
This is a (*messy*) collection of scripts designed to analyze data from a pair of scintillators. The scintillators were observing cosmic ray muons.

We get a pretty good estimate of the muon lifetime ((2.205 Â± 0.062) microseconds), and after deconvolution, a decent measurement of how muon flux depends on zenith angle.
